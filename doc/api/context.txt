@brief An object which is required to exist for es::Sockets to be used.
@details This ensures that any underlying setup and cleanup code is called.
<br>For example:
<code>
es::Context context{}; // must be created before any sockets are created
es::Socket socket{es::IpVersion::ipv4, es::Protocol::tcp};
socket.bind({"0.0.0.0", 8080});
</code>
<br>Can be moved from but not copied. Members are the same across all implementations.
