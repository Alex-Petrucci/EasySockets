@brief An object which represents a connection between two applications.
@details On creation, type of ip addresses that the socket will use and the
layer 4/transport layer protocol is specified.
<br>From this, methods like <code>.bind_to(EndPoint end_point)</code>
and <code>.connect_to(EndPoint end_point)</code> to give the socket
an address and port so that it can start communicating with other applications.
<br>For connectionless protocols like UDP, data can be sent and received
without binding or connecting first.
<br>Can be moved from but not copied. Members are the same across all implementations.
