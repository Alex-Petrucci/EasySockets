# Contributing to EasySockets
If you would like to contribute to this library then
please only make contributions for issues that have been
approved to be worked on. 

If there is a change you would like to make or a new feature 
that you would like to add and there is no issue for it,
then feel free to create an issue yourself.

This is to make sure that people don't waste their time
writing code for things which may not get merged.

Please make sure you match the code style of the already
existing code to keep consistency.

Just because you create an issue does not mean that a change
will be made. All issues will be considered first before being
given approval to be worked on.

All contributions will be merged into the `dev` branch first
and then once the library is ready for a new release, the `dev`
branch will be merged into the `main` branch.

If you are struggling with a contribution, feel free to post something
on the discussions tab so that someone can help you out.
